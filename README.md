## 1340-Group-Project

Assumption:
The maxium avaiable table in this restaurant is 20.

For the problem statement, first problem is how to finding the available table. Second problem is how to determine the table occupied or not. Third problem is which table can be released. Fourth problem is how to choose the most suitable seats for the customers with minimal seats. Fifth problem is how to know the occupation time of each tables. Sixth problem is that the number of tables and the size of tables will be changed seasonally. 

For the problem setting, we assume that each seats is only available for one person. Child is also considered as one person. There is no customers occupying the table when changing the size and the number of tables. Also, the seat will be occupied if and only if the customer in on seat while the seat will be released if and only if the customer settles payment. When customers occupied a table, they cannot change the table.

The function we want to implement is the reservation system which customers can book the table for a certain period. There is no customers add-on after confirming booking.
